# Spec-First Development

Write specifications before creating branches. Use aspec workflow to generate tasks from specs (`/aspec-01-project-spec` through `/aspec-20-implement`).

## Guidelines
- Define requirements before implementation
- One task = one branch
- Review generated tasks before starting
- Document acceptance criteria

## Activation
- **Mode**: Always On
- **Applies to**: All development work
