# Change Log
## v0.12.0-beta [2018-??-??]
* General changes:
  * Adding a prefix `NOGDB_` for all NogDB exception code.
  * `nogdb::Db::getRecord(...)` now throws an exception `NOGDB_CTX_NOEXST_RECORD` when `rid` in a given record descriptor can't be found in the datastore.
* New features:
  * Implementing a feature request [#37](https://github.com/nogdb/nogdb/issues/37). Collections such as `std::pair`, `std::array`, `std::vector`, `std::map`, `std::set` can now be parsed to `nogdb::Bytes`, which allows users to store them in record, through static API function `nogdb::Bytes nogdb::Bytes::toBytes<T>(const T&)`.
* Implemented enhancements:
  * `nogdb::Error` is now an interface class for all NogDB error implementations such as `nogdb::ContextError`, `nogdb::StorageError`, `nogdb::GraphError`, `nogdb::TxnError`, and `nogdb::SQLError`.
  * The underlying storage engine (LMDB) interface and implementation have been improved a lot in term of extendability, readability, and performance. No more environment handlers required for NogDB context.
* Fixed bugs:
  * Fixing the algorithm for graph traversal with empty edges. Previously, it was working incorrectly by considering empty edges as invalid objects which could not be used to traverse to adjacent vertices.
  * Fixing issue [#26](https://github.com/nogdb/nogdb/issues/26). A SQL with `SELECT @version` causes segmentation fault.
  * Fixing issue [#27](https://github.com/nogdb/nogdb/issues/27). A SQL with `SELECT count()` may cause heap buffer overflow.
  * Fixing issue [#28](https://github.com/nogdb/nogdb/issues/28). A SQL with `SELECT walk[condition].property` may cause segmentation fault.
  * Fixing issue [#29](https://github.com/nogdb/nogdb/issues/29). A SQL with `SELECR walk[condition].property as alias` may cause segmentation fault when getting the `alias` value.
  * Temporarily fixing issue [#45](https://github.com/nogdb/nogdb/issues/45). Indexing attributes cause something wrong with `get` functions. This is resolved by bypassing an index search but still creating index records in the data storage.

## v0.11.0-beta [2018-06-18]
* General changes:
  * All `nogdb::Vertex::find*(...)` and `nogdb::Edge::find*(...)` functions are obsoleted and have been renamed to `nogdb::Vertex::get*(...)` and `nogdb::Edge::get*(...)` respectively.
  * `nogdb::Class::create(...)` and `nogdb::Class::createExtend(...)` with `PropertyMapType` functions are deprecated.
  * The maximum size of property value has been increased and now it can be up to 2,147,483,648 bytes (from 65,536 bytes previously).
  * Removing dash (-) from a set of valid characters for class name and property name. A valid name for class and property must be A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and underscore (_) but cannot begin with numbers (0-9).
* New features:
  * A member function `getProperties(...)` in `nogdb::Record` which returns a set of property names in a record is available.
  * Supporting SQL for graph manipulation, retrieval, and traversal via `nogdb::SQL::execute(...)`.
  * Each record now contains some basic information such as `@className`, `@recordId`, `@depth`, and `@version` by default. These values are read-only and unable to be overwritten. 
* Implemented enhancements:
  * Adding some class and property name restrictions.
  * Improving the way to internally handle a cursor pointer of `MDB_cursor` in order to prevent memory leak problems by applying RAII principle for `Datastore::CursorHandlerWrapper`.
  * Removing all C assertion in the library to prevent terminating the program unexpectedly when there are some internal errors occurring. Therefore, the library will throw an exception `CTX_INTERNAL_ERR` for any internal errors instead.
  * Storing `uint8_t` and `int8_t` as `uint32_t` and `int32_t` respectively in database indexing for all compilers and systems compatibility.
* Fixed bugs:
  * Fixing issue [#11](https://github.com/nogdb/nogdb/issues/11). A SQL syntax error found when using `TRAVERSE` clause inside `SELECT`.
  * Fixing issue [#12](https://github.com/nogdb/nogdb/issues/12). An exception `SQL_INVALID_PROJECTION` thrown after getting out-of-bound index in SQL syntax.
  * Fixing several bugs in database indexing retrieval operations. Some issues are able to be found and still unresolved. Better to avoid using database indexing feature in this version.
  * Fixing issue [#18](https://github.com/nogdb/nogdb/issues/18). SQL parser can't parse escape quote (\' or \").
  * Fixing issue [#20](https://github.com/nogdb/nogdb/issues/20). An exception `SQL_SYNTAX_ERROR` thrown after getting `<condition> <operator> <multi-condition>` on SQL clause.
  * Fixing issue [#22](https://github.com/nogdb/nogdb/issues/22). Using `SKIP` with nested query may cause segmentation fault.
  
## v0.10.0-beta [2018-03-24]
* General changes:
  * `nogdb::Condition` and `nogdb::Comparator` have been re-designed by combining them into one functionality as `nogdb::Comparator` has become member functions of `nogdb::Condition`, for example, `eq(...)`, `lt(...)`, `contain(...)`, and etc. This would help to support more comparators such as `in(...)`, `like(...)`, `regex(...)` and some comparators that utilize the advantages of NogDB indexing such as range search and `between(...)`.
  * A member function `hasTo(...)` in `nogdb::ResultSetCursor` has been renamed to `hasAt(...)` for a better meaningful function name.
* New features:
  * More comparators have been added, for instance, `in(...)`, `between(...)`, `like(...)` and `regex(...)`, as member functions of `nogdb::Condition`.
  * An implementation of NogDB indexing for properties in classes provides two more function APIs, `nogdb::Property::createInex(...)` and `nogdb::Property::dropIndex(...)`, that support creating and dropping unique/non-unique index in a database. This would help to increase a performance of searching for matching records in vertex and edge classes via `find(...)` and `findCursor(...)` functions.
  * `nogdb::Vertex::findIndex(...)`, `nogdb::Vertex::findCursorIndex(...)`, `nogdb::Edge::findIndex(...)`, and `nogdb::Edge::findCursorIndex(...)` have been added to function APIs to support getting records from index tables directly.
* Implemented enhancements:
  * Internal functions which are a part of LMDB interfaces can now directly support numeric types as a key. This would improve the performance by getting rid out of `string` to `unsigned int` conversions and also help to reduce disk space utilisation.
  * Since keys stored in LMDB are allowed to be numeric types, all position ids stored in data storage are kept as `unsigned int` keys and always sorted. A new record can be easily added at the last position of the associated data storage by using a LMDB APPEND flag which results in a small overhead and less time to perform the insert operation.
  * Eliminating the use of threads running underlying NogDB library by cleaning up obsoleted versions and increasing memory space when performing transaction commit and rollback.
  * The underlying representation of graph and transaction has been revised and improved in order to have better performance and support cleaning all obsoleted objects in memory without a separated graph cleaner thread.
  * The transaction for schema operations is now supported to allow CRUD for a database schema in the same transaction with CRUD for vertex and edge records.
* Fixed bugs:
  * Not throwing an exception `CTX_NOEXST_PROPERTY` when calling `getText(...)` with invalid properties or with an empty string as a result.
  * Removing an incorrect lock object in a locking mechanism of a transaction commit for edges.
  * Several bugs associated with database schema have been fixed during an implementation of schema with transaction.

## v0.9.0-alpha [2018-01-10]
* General changes:
  * All `nogdb::Db::getSchema` functions have been modified to support `nogdb::Context` as a parameter instead of `nogdb::Txn` in order to decrease a number of instructions when getting database schema (no transactions required).
  * A member function of `nogdb::Bytes` - `getBytes()` has been renamed to `getRaw()`.
  * Vertex and edge functions for creating multiple records at once have been removed in order to reduce the use of STL containers in function signature.
  * A function parameter `const std::string& className` (and also `const std::set<std::string>& className`) in all function signatures related to record retrieval have been removed in order to reduce the use of STL containers in function signature and make function APIs much simpler.
* New features:
  * A `NOT` operation as `operator!` for `nogdb::Condition` and `nogdb::Expression` has been implemented to fully support all possible conditions for record retrieval and conditional graph traversal functions.
  * New graph and record operation functions have been implemented to provide better memory utilization and avoid out-of-memory problems by supporting a returned object - `nogdb::ResultSetCursor` - that would be used to iterate through each metadata instead of returning the whole data records at once like `nogdb::ResultSet` which utilizes a huge size of memory to store both metadata and raw records.
  * A set of new member functions in regard to `nogdb::Record` which can return a value of properties in a record as a primitive type.
  * An empty record is now eligible for creating and updating vertex and edge records.
  * A new type - `nogdb::ClassFilter` - has been implemented for filtering class names in edge record retrieval with conditions.
* Implemented enhancements:
  * An implementation of `nogdb::Condition`, `nogdb::Expression`, `nogdb::PathFilter`, `nogdb::Bytes`, and `nogdb::Record` has been hidden by being moved from header files to internal source files.
* Fixed bugs:
  * Creating a new class with properties previously used an incorrect type to define a types of properties. This critical bug will cause a failure of property-type mapping when the database context is reloaded. The bug had been already fixed by using the actual property type instead of a class type when saving into a datastore.
  
## v0.8.0-alpha [2017-11-02]
* General changes:
  * Adding a graceful way to compile and build a library through `cmake` which supports building and installing software on multiple platforms.
  * `nogdb::Context::DBInfo` has been moved out from a database context and become a separate type `nogdb::DBInfo`.
  * Two member functions, `and_` and `or_`, for combining multiple `nogdb::Condition` and `nogdb::Expression` objects have been replaced by using overloading and/or operations such as `operator&&` and `operator||`.
  * All functions in record operations have `nogdb::Txn` as the first parameter instead of `nogdb::Context` to support a new graph transaction feature. 
* New features:
  * A graph transaction has been implemented and now available through `nogdb::Txn` on all record operations.
* Implemented enhancements:
  * An implementation of `RecordIdHash` has been represented as `boost::hash<RecordId>` due to a better performance while only relevant boost header files are included in the lib directory under the project. 
* Fixed bugs:
  * There was no mutex locks in `getDbInfo()` which may cause concurrency problem. The concurrency control on database information can be done by an implementation of a mutex over `nogdb::DBInfo` in a database context together with a transaction.
  * `nogdb::Context` cannot be initiated as rvalue by using moving constructor or assigned as rvalue by using move assignment correctly. This has been fixed by completing the rule of five in `nogdb::Context`.

## v0.7.0-alpha [2017-08-12]
* General changes:
  * All function API interfaces have been changed and all internal implementations have been significantly refactored.
  * `nogdb::current_timestamp` might not allow to be used publicly as a function api.
  * All internal implementations are now hidden from a client program.
* Implemented enhancements:
  * An internal implementation and logic related to retrieving records by path filtering has been separated from each graph traversal algorithm.
  * A usage of `boost::hash<RecordId>` has been replaced with an internal implementation of `RecordIdHash`. 
  * All usages of boost library have been removed so that a size of nogdb library and a number of dependencies will be decreased.
* Fixed bugs:
  * Makefile has been improved to be suitable for source code after refactoring.
  * Makefile has been also fixed to appropriately build a static library according to a static library compilation problem with a client program.
  * Makefile has been also fixed for uninstalling `libnogdb.*` in /usr/local/lib.
  
## v0.6.0-alpha [2017-07-17]
* General changes:
  * The majority of coding style has been improved to increase readability and support both GCC and LLVM compilers.
  * `nogdb::Executor::traverse_*` receives both `minDepth` and `maxDepth` as parameters rather than only `depth` to specify the lower and upper boundaries of graph traversal.
  * Adding two additional numeric types for properties such as `nogdb::PropertyType::SHORTINT` for signed 16-bit integer and `nogdb::PropertyType::UNSIGNED_SHORTINT` for unsigned 16-bit integer.
* New features:
  * The operations with `nogdb::Expression` have been implemented. It allows all operations having `nogdb::Condition` as their paramters to accept `nogdb::Expression` for considering only records that match expressions taking an effect of the operations as well.
  * The old operations `nogdb::Executor::traverse_*` have been changed to `nogdb::Executor::bfs_traverse_*` since they used breath first search algorithm as their internal implementation.
  * Graph operations `nogdb::Executor::dfs_traverse_*` have been implemented and introduced for graph traversal using depth first search algorithm as their internal implementation.
  * `nogdb::Comparator` provides some additional comparators in the following pattern - `nogdb::Comparator::*_CASE` - for string matching with case sensitive. 
  * All `nogdb::Executor::find_*` and `nogdb::Executor::find_edge_*` functions can now support a conditional function in order to search for records by using customised and complicated conditions which are defined in `bool condition(const nogdb::Record& record)`. 
  * All `nogdb::Executor::find_*` and `nogdb::Executor::find_edge_*` functions can now support having a class name as `@className` and a record id as `@recordId` in `nogdb::Condition` and `nogdb::Expression` in order to search for records in a specific class and record id with particular conditions.
  * A path filtering - `nogdb::PathFilter` - has been implemented and available for filtering paths in graph traversal which uses only relevant vertices and edges that match with conditions defined inside a pointer to function `bool condition(const nogdb::Record& record)`.
* Implemented enhancements:
  * Getting raw data from the datastore directly while performing graph traversal and finding the shortest path in graph algorithm functions so that it can support a path filtering mechanism.
  
## v0.5.0-alpha [2017-06-10]
* General changes:
  * `nogdb::exec::create_class` and `nogdb::exec::add_property` throw an exception `CTX_LIMIT_DBSCHEMA` when a limitation of a database schema has been reached instead of terminating a program by assertion.
  * All find operations - `nogdb::exec::find_*` - have been changed to accept `nogdb::condition` and `nogdb::expr` as one of parameters for selecting matched records instead of passing 3 parameters together such as `std::string propName`, `T value`, and `nogdb::comparator cmp` for constructing a condition. An internal implemenation of all find operations have also been improved to support `nogdb::condition` (but not yet for `nogdb::expr`).
  * `struct utils` has been removed so that everyone can use all utility-related functions directly.
* New features:
  * `nogdb::exec::create_vertex` and `nogdb::exec::create_edge` can now support multiple-record insertion (bulk operations).
  * `nogdb::exec::delete_vertex` and `nogdb::exec::delete_edge` can now support an operation for deleting all records in a class.
  * Adding two additional numeric types for properties such as `nogdb::proptype::tinyint` for signed 8-bit integer and `nogdb::proptype::utinyint` for unsigned 8-bit integer.
  * `nogdb::classtype` has been renamed to `nogdb::class_type`, `nogdb::proptype` has been renamed to `nogdb::property_type`, and `nogdb::cmp` has been renamed to `nogdb::comparator` for better understanding in term of naming and convention.
  * `nogdb::condition` and `nogdb::expr` have been implemented and introduced. They can be useful for searching records in vertices and edges with multiple conditions in a complex expression.
* Implemented enhancements:
  * A context lock file has been implemented in order to prevent a database context from being opened and used by more than one process or thread. This will restrict a multi-thread program to use the same context to connect to a particular database and not allow other programs to open and use the same database simultaneously. This property can strongly preserve a database consistency for in-memory schema and relations by belonging to only one process.
  * Replacing all numeric primitive data types (such as `int`, `unsigned int`, `long`, and `unsigned long`), whose size could be dependent on compilers and cpu architecture, with standard fixed size types (such as `int32_t`, `uint32_t`, `int64_t` and `uint64_t`) so that the datastore can be compatible with multiple platforms and with the same representation of numeric types in term of their size.
* Fixed bugs:
  * An internal generic function `parse_raw_data` previously converted raw data of deleted properties in a record incorrectly. This bug has been fixed by correcting the way to calculate an offset of each property block.
  
## v0.4.0-alpha [2017-05-28]
* General changes:
  * A new implementation of the database configuration and variables to prevent any external accesses to those values by replacing `struct default_conf` with `class db_constant`.
  * The constructor of `nogdb::context` optionally accepts 2 more variables, `maxDbNum` and `maxDbSize`, for configuring a maximum number of internal opened databases and a maximum size of databases respectively.
  * `classname` has been removed from `struct record_descriptor`.
  * An exception `CTX_RID_ERR` has been removed from a list of exceptions and it will never be thrown from the database since there are no problems regarding a mismatch between classname and rid in `struct record_descriptor` due to the removal of `classname` in `struct record_descriptor`. 
  * `nogdb::class_descriptor` has been wrapped by a new `nogdb::class_descriptor` for hiding some internal representations and pointers. There are some changes and differences between the old and new `nogdb::class_descriptor`, such as inheritance support and static values for all members of `nogdb::class_descriptor`. 
* New features:
  * `nogdb::exec::traverse_all` has been implemented for graph traversal considering both directions of edges (incoming and outgoing).
  * `nogdb::exec::create_class_extend` has been available for creating a subclass which extends from its superclass and also supporting inheritance concept.
  * `nogdb::exec::alter_class` has been available for renaming a class.
  * `nogdb::exec::create_class` can now return `struct class_descriptor` and `nogdb::exec::add_property` can also return `struct property_descriptor`.
* Implemented enhancements:
  * The function signature of `nogdb::exec::get_schema` has been changed from `context& ctx` to `const context& ctx` in order to prevent any modifications that could be made in the function.
  * `nogdb::exec::get_vertex`, `nogdb::exec::get_edge`, `nogdb::exec::find_vertex`, and `nogdb::exec::find_edge` can support record retrieval for multiple classes.
  * An internal implementation of a relation (graph) has been changed by converting `class graph` into a class with non-static member functions.
  * An internal implementation of `nogdb::schema` has been modified to be a class, instead of `typedef`, with direct and inverse mapping between class names to `class_descriptor` and class ids to `class_descriptor`.
  * Added a proper validation process.
  * All duplication removal methods regarding class and property passing via function parameters have been removed in order to reduce a number of validation steps by restricting client programs to use only `std::set<std::string>` for passing a set of class and property names as `std::string`.
  * Several internal implementations have been added and updated for supporting extended classes in terms of schema and record operations.
* Fixed bugs:
  * The program could get into an undefined stage and throw some exceptions caused by an invalid `classId` referencing in `nogdb::exec::create_class` with predefined properties. `nogdb::exec::create_class` can now create a class with predefined properties using a valid classId from `nogdb::context::dbinfo`.
  * Dropping a class of vertices using `nogdb::drop_class` actually removed data records of vertices only. However, their relations and associated edges were still remaining in the datastore and would be incorrectly loaded into a memory when the context was re-initialized which may cause some undefined behaviour. `nogdb::drop_class` can now delete all edges associated with a dropped vertex class in the datastore as well as the in-memory relations.    

## v0.3.0-alpha [2017-04-12]
* General changes:
  * `class exec` has been corrected and changed to `struct exec`.
  * `nogdb::exec::get_vertices` and `nogdb::exec::get_edges` have been renamed to `nogdb::exec::get_vertex` and `nogdb::exec::get_edge` respectively.
  * all LMDB source codes have been merged into the project; as a result, no dependencies except `boost` required to be manually installed before compiling `nogdb` library.
  * `CTX_FORBIDDEN_CLASSTYPE` and `CTX_FORBIDDEN_PROPTYPE` have been changed to `CTX_INVALID_CLASSTYPE` and `CTX_INVALID_PROPTYPE` respectively.
  * `nogdb::exec::update_edge_src` and `nogdb::exec::update_edge_dst` have been renamed to `nogdb::exec::update_vertex_src` and `nogdb::exec::update_vertex_dst` respectively for better understanding.
  * Makefile has been created and modified to support some popular Unix and Linux platforms such as macOS, Ubuntu, RHEL/CentOS, and BSD.
  * The compiler has been changed from GNU (gcc/g++) to LLVM (clang/clang++).
* New features:
  * Some major primitive data types such as `integer`, `unsigned int`, `double`, `string`, and etc., including a binary object as an array of `unsigned char` can be converted into `nogdb::bytes` through a constructor of `nogdb::bytes`.
  * `convert_to(T& object)` has become available for converting `nogdb::bytes` to an object.
  * `nogdb::exec::get_vertex_all` has been added for getting both source and destination vertices of an edge.
  * `nogdb::exec::get_edge_all` has been added for getting edges by considering both directions.
  * Vertex, edge, and record retrieval with a given condition is now available, for example, `nogdb::exec::find_vertex`, `nogdb::exec::find_edge`, `nogdb::exec::find_edge_in`, `nogdb::exec::find_edge_out`, and `nogdb::exec::find_edge_all`.
* Implemented enhancements:
  * Increasing a performance of edge record retrieval by reducing a number of created objects as a parameter when passing through a function `get_resolved_records` for getting records from `record_descriptor`.
  * A duplication in an implementation of edge retrieval functions has been revised and eliminated.
  * `nogdb::exec::create_class`, `nogdb::exec::add_property`, and `nogdb::exec::alter_property` can now prevent using an empty string as classname and property name for creating classes and properties. Additional exceptions, `CTX_INVALID_CLASSNAME` and `CTX_INVALID_PROPERTYNAME`, will be returned from those schema operations if an empty string provided.  
* Fixed bugs:
  * `nogdb::exec::update_vertex_dst` previously threw an exception of `type std::out_of_range: map::at:  key not found`. This problem has been resolved by changing `oldTarget` in `graph::alter_edge_dst` from `edge->source.lock()` to `edge->target.lock()` and now it can refer to the right direction.
  * Once an empty string has been set and stored into a database, calling `record.get(...).to_text()` can return an empty string instead of aborting a program with an assertion failure.
  * `nogdb::utils::current_timestamp` can now return the correct timestamp in milliseconds since the Unix epoch.
 
## v0.2.0-alpha [2017-03-05]
* General changes:
  * `nogdb::command` and `class command` have been renamed to `nogdb::exec` and `class exec` respectively.
  * `class_name` in `nogdb::record_descriptor` has been changed to `classname`. 
  * A new nogdb type, `nogdb::result`, has been separated from `nogdb::result_set` containing two attributes, `nogdb::record_descriptor` and `nogdb::record`.
  * A return type of `nogdb::exec::get_vertex_src` and `nogdb::exec::get_vertex_dst` has been changed to `nogdb::result`.
  * A member function `is_null()` in `nogdb::bytes` and `nogdb::record` has been changed to `empty()`.
  * A member function `length()` in `nogdb::bytes` has been changed to `size()`.
  * Some member variables and functions of internal classes has been modified, for example:
    * modified a representation of `graph::rid` from `std::pair<classid, oid>` to `std::pair<clsid, posid>` in `class graph`.
    * modified member variables in `graph::relations` from `v` and `e` to `vertices` and `edges` respectively in `class graph`.
    * modified member variables in `graph::edge` from `src` and `dst` to `source` and `target` respectively in `class graph`.
    * modified member functions in `dstore::blob` from `value()` to `bytes()` in `class dstore::blob`.
    * modified member variables in `dstore::default_value` from `flags` to `flag` in `class dstore`.
  * Code cleaning and reorganisation.
* New features:
  * `nogdb::create_class` has `std::map<std::string, nogdb::proptype>` as an optional parameter to create properties of a class within the same function after the class has been successfully created.
  * `nogdb::exec::get_edge_in` and `nogdb::exec::get_edge_out` have a classname (or a set of classnames) of edges as an optional parameter for returning only a set of results related to specified edges.
  * `nogdb::record` has some additional member functions such as `clear()` - to clear all properties and values, and `unset(const std::string& className)` - to clear a specific property and its value.
  * `nogdb::traverse_in` and `nogdb::traverse_out` are available for graph traversal.
  * `nogdb::shortest_path` is also available for finding a shortest path between two vertices in a graph.
* Implemented enhancements:
  * A graph library has been changed from BGL to an internal implementation for graph traversal development compatibility.
  * Read/write locks for database operations have been improved to prevent concurrency problems.
* Fixed bugs:
  * `boost::remove_vertex` no longer causes a Segmentation Fault issue in `drop_class()` since a graph library has been changed.

## v0.1.0-alpha [2017-01-09]
* New features:
  * All features are implemented as specified in a documentation.
* Implemented enhancements:
  * No enhancements implemented in this version.
* Fixed bugs:
  * No bugs fixed in this version.
